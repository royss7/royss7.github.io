- I typically ask my teams to come up with an initial dev/test set and an initial metric in less
  than one week—rarely longer. It is better to come up with something imperfect and get going
  quickly, rather than overthink this. 
- If you find that your dev set performance is much better than your test set
  performance, it is a sign that you have overfit to the dev set. In this case, get a fresh dev set.
- Instead, build and train a basic system quickly—perhaps in just a few days
- In detail, here’s what you can do:
  1. Gather a sample of 100 dev set examples that your system misclassified. I.e., examples
     that your system made an error on.
  2. Look at these examples manually, and count what fraction of them are dog images.
- Error analysis is an iterative process.
